The data for the BigDays needs to be updated. Currently it only contains information from 1994 to 2018. This needs to be extended to 2020. As such, additional NARR data and climate data will need to be downloaded and added to the `RData` file. This work will closely follow that outlined in the **DefineBigDays** repository on my github page.
